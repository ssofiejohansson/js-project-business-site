My first project in the JS bootcamp.

This project is a responsive business website that showcase products with a clean and interactive layout. It features a navigation bar that adjusts based on the screen size, with a fully functional hamburger menu for mobile and tablet devices. The layout is built using CSS Grid for the main structure and Flexbox for smaller components like the cards and articles. The site includes a responsive header with a video, along with a signup form that supports multiple input types. The website is designed to be fully responsive, ensuring a great user experience for all devices.
